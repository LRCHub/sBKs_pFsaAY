[00:00.50] Aah, it's time to relax
[00:02.77] And you know what that means
[00:04.45] A glass of wine, your favorite easy chair
[00:06.62] And of course, this compact disc playing on your home stereo
[00:11.96] So go on, and indulge yourself... that's right!
[00:15.44] Kick off your shoes, put your feet up
[00:17.87] Lean back and just enjoy the melodies
[00:21.42] After all, music soothes even the savage beast
