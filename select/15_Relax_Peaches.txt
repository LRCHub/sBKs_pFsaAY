I got to the hilton full throttle full on
Choke the bottle and i take it strong
Come a little closer can u hear my thong
Whats the matter boy i say something wrong
Take my pulse and add insult
Smoke alittle cigarette and join my cult
I get results doin summa summa salts
Think you got the combination
Crack that vault
No votes just coast
Im the virus your the host

Relax
Slip in the cracks
Ill take you to another place
We're makin contact
Relax
Slip in the cracks
Ill take you to another place

Just press start on my main machine
Site on scene another halloween
Strip sixteen on my mosiclean
Bam bam bam that how the party begin
Wham wham wham its all a part of the damned
Takin stand bringin the glam shizam

Ground floor french door
One more whatchu waiting for

Sweet sweat gland come and take my hand
Sink in the sand to my holy land
Bring on the chaos the sauce galore
