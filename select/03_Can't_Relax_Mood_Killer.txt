Been checking my pulse, hope it slows down
I check for signs of alien life
Bloodshot, I bolt for the door
Can't stay anymore
Good god, I'm shaking, about to explode

Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax

Defibrillate me at the party
Tried to tell them don't resuscitate
Sticky finger touching my head
Gonna choke on what you just said
Anal retentive and ready to roll

Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax

I'll have the last laugh
I'll have the last laugh
I'll handle it
You will admit
I'll have the last laugh

Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
Gotta slow down
Wanna slow down
How to slow down?
I can't relax
